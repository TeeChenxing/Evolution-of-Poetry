  The Evolution of Poetry
</h1>

### General Info

This project was initialized to analyze poetry and perform different types of inspection to gain knowledge of the changes and similarities of poems over time. 
The project focused on poems from the 1200s - 1900s where we used the NRCLex library and others to perform sentiment analysis, text classification, keyword extraction etc.

### Data Collection

The data was webscraped from ```http://poetry-archive.com/``` which has a collection poems from before the 13th century till the present day. 

### Installation

To see the analysis, run the ```project_dashboard.py``` file. This would create a dashboard locally where the link to the dashboard will be displayed in the terminal after
running the file.
